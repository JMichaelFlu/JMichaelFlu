- 👋 Hi, I’m Jacob
- 📚 I am interested in a wide variety of topics and activities. I dont see why I should limit myself, so I take every day to kearn something new cause I'm a big ol nerd.
- 👨🏻‍💻 I’m currently learning the basics of programming actually. I don't know that I have the mind or talent for it, but like a lot of millennials, I was pretending I was a character on Hackers, writing HTML for my Myspace page back in the day, so let's see. 
- 😆 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that enrich our lives, brings a laugh or two, connection is why we are here, a community that supports each other. It's naive but I have to believe that. 
- 📫 How to reach me I finally kicked the heavy social media habit but [This will help us connect on the spaces I still have](jacobfluharty.link) 
- 🏳️‍🌈 Pronouns: He/Him but I don't care what you call me. 
- 🤓 Fun fact: Having a mid life crisis at (almost) 37 years old. Quit my job with no real plan, no savings, but a lot moxie.
- 🐍 I am sticking with just learning Python at the moment and that is enough of a handful. Ive been teaching myself a lot about working with AI Bots and machine learning in general.
